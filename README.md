Sample HubSpot Activity for Robocloud - created by Warren Eiserman
Caveat - I am new to robocloud, so please do not consider this best practice.



Read Hubspot Deal information via API.
This demonstrates the use of secrets in Robocloud and how to interpret JSON

In order to run this sample you need to:
1> Enter a deal ID in the /variable/variables.py
2> Create your HubSpot API key in the robocloud vault using the apikey as the name value pair
